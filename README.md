Welcome to my playground...!

This is a repository where I practice and learn coding. 

I make use of questions from HackerEarth > https://www.hackerearth.com/

The solution to the challenges maybe in different languages as this is more focused on problem solving and logic over language proficiency.

NOTE: Sometimes HackerEarth remove problems from their website. I'm not aware of the reason. Hence, I also provide a README inside every folder for you to go through the question incase you don't find it on the above mentioned website. I encourage you to try solving the problems before jumping into the solutions.

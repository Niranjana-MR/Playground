#Welcome to my playground...!

This is a repository where I practice and learn coding. 

I make use of questions available online. This is mostly going to be from HackerEarth(https://www.hackerearth.com/) or CodeWars(https://www.codewars.com/). 

The solution to the challenges maybe in different languages as this is more focused on problem solving and logic over language proficiency.

NOTE: I also provide a README inside every folder for you to go through the question incase you don't find it on the above mentioned websites. I encourage you to try solving the problems before jumping into the solutions.

<h2>Caesar Cipher Helper</h2>
<br>
Write a class that, when given a string, will return an uppercase string with each letter shifted forward in the alphabet by however many spots the cipher was initialized to.

For example:

var c = new CaesarCipher(5); // creates a CipherHelper with a shift of five
c.encode('Codewars'); // returns 'HTIJBFWX'
c.decode('BFKKQJX'); // returns 'WAFFLES'

If something in the string is not in the alphabet (e.g. punctuation, spaces), simply leave it as is.
The shift will always be in range of [1, 26].
